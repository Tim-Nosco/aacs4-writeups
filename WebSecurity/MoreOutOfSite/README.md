# More Out of Site

## Web Security -- 10 points

### Description

Well that was embarrassing... Who knew there was more to a web site then what the browser showed? Not to worry, we're back with a new and improved Javascript version! http://{{server}}:{{port}}

### Hints

* The Javascript code in an onInput gets called anytime you interact with a text field.
* Is there anyway to view the Javascript definition of this function? It should just be text and your browser has it somewhere (it is running it after all).
