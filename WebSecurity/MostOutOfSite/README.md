# Most Out of Site

## Web Security -- 20 points

### Description

Alright, one more try. We had to think long and hard about how to keep you from viewing the flag. After a quick snack break, we had an epiphany. Your tricks won't work this time. http://{{server}}:{{port}}

### Hints

* What on earth could [snack food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) have to do with this problem?
* The browser must be storing these cookies somewhere...
* If you're getting tired of using a browser, the Python [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library is pretty useful for interacting with web servers.
