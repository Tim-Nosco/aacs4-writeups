# Who Is That In That Mirror

## Web Security -- 300 points

### Description

We found a database backup from the Mirror Warehouse on the dark web. Take a look at the [database.sql](./database.sql) and see if you can compromise the Mirror Warehouse Website.  
The 'dark web' is slow, dont't worry, it may take up to 60 seconds for the site to come up.

### Hints

* Sometimes [SQL injection](https://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/Cutlip/BH_US_12_Cutlip_SQL_Exploitation_WP.pdf) is just the beginning of an exploit.
* The website is written in Flask (and thus python3 is installed on the server).
