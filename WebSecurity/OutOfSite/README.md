### Description

The flag submission system lets us see the strings you submitted even when they're wrong. Since some of you may consider that a privacy issue, we decided to demo a flag validation system that checks it client-side before sending the flag to us for checking. Why don't you give it a try: http://{{server}}:{{port}}

### Hints

* How does your browser know what the right key is to do the check?
* If only there were a way to control+U're view of what the server sent you.
