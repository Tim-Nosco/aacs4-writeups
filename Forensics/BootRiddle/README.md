# Boot Riddle

## Forensics -- 100 points

### Description

This floppy disk [files.tar.gz](./files.tar.gz) boots, but instead of a flag we see some silly riddle...

### Hints

* If only we could inspect the device's memory while it is running...
* QEMU's [monitor](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QEMU/Monitor) or Bochs' [debugger](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/doc/docbook/user/internal-debugger.html) might be useful to read up on.
