# That's More Than Enough

## Forensics -- 100 points

### Description

We think Jolly Jeff is up to no good. See if you can find the hidden message in his [JPEG Jammer](http://{{server}}:{{port}}).

### Hints

* Hex editors, such as bless or wxHexEditor, are great for viewing file contents. Install bless with "sudo apt install bless" or wxhexeditor with "sudo apt install wxhexeditor".
* Take a look at the [JPEG file format specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format#File_format_structure).
