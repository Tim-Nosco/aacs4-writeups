# Say What?

## Reverse Engineering -- 200 points

### Description

We intercepted some foreign documents. We think there's interesting information inside but the file is protected with a unique password algorithm: [chall.docm](./chall.docm)

### Hints

* Microsoft Office documents sometimes carry with them a powerful set of macros
* Microsoft Office is not required to extract the malicious macro, or solve the challenge
* There are a number of open source security tooling to script the extraction of Office macros
* The macro's obfuscation is rather light, try inserting some MsgBox prints to make sense of what it is doing
* If you're not careful, the document might ... change itself. Double check that your solution works against a 'fresh' copy of the challenge.
