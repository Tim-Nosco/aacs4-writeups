# Can You Look This Over?

### Description

Our ops guys found a malware author's staging server, we managed to exfiltrate the source to a backdoor they are spreading: [backdoor.tar.gz](./backdoor.tar.gz). I need you to report back once you have cracked their secret password.

### Hints

* What version / release of OpenSSH is in the provided archive?
* We know that their backdoor allows 'root' to login with a secret password
* Try diffing the backdoor tarball against the original source!
* The hashed password may be mixed case alphanumreic, but there shouldn't be any symbols!
