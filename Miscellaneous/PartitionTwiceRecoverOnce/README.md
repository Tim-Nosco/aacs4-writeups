# Partition Twice, Recover Once

## Miscellaneous -- 250 points

### Description

I think I may have overwritten my secure file store, do you think you could recover the data for me? The password for the encrypted partition is "secret1234". [image.bin](./image.bin)

### Hints

* What is the current format of the image?
* What data is leftover from the original partition?
* Look at the last chunk of data in the image
