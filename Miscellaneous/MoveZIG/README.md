# Move ZIG

## Miscellaneous -- 75 points

### Description

CATS is back at it on {{server}}:{{port}}. Only this time he's throwing 500 problems at you. If you didn't use a program to solve the last one, you'll probably want [starter\_code.py](./starter\_code.py)...

### Hints

* We'll be impressed if you solve this without writing code. The hints on 'All Your Base Are Belong to Us' are still relevant here as well.


### Write-up
