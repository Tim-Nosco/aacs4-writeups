# Do you C what I C

## Binary Exploitation -- 250 points

### Description

Remembering numbers is hard, luckily we've made [do\_you\_c\_what\_I\_c.exe](./do\_you\_c\_what\_I\_c.exe) to remember them for us! Launch it now!

### Hints

* It looks like they only added bounds checks on writes - I wonder if we can do anything with that?
* Where are stack cookies stored?
* I wonder what happens if you try to write more than 4 bytes?
* Maybe the [\_\_cdecl](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/cdecl?view=vs-2019) call puts something interesting on the stack?
* What memory protections are disabled?
* The flag is at D:\flag.txt
